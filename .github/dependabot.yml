    # Unfortunately, we don't want automatic PRs until such a time
    # that `make modules` and `make generate` can be run to update all
    # of the go modules in one go and get passing PRs.
    #
    # Maintainers can continue to look at the log in
    # https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/network/updates/
