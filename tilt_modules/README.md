# Tilt Extensions

This folder houses Tilt extensions used by Cluster API's Tiltfile.

Extensions are open-source packaged functions that extend the capability Tilt, right inside your Tiltfile; think code snippets for your Tiltfile, publically available and easily sharable.

For more on Tilt extensions, [see the docs](https://docs.tilt.dev/extensions.html).
