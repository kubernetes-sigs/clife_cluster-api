# Clusterctl

## Compatibility notice

Clusterctl CLI is developed in lock-step with Cluster API, it's strongly recommended to  use the latest released version for the series you're using. For example, if you're managing clusters with Cluster API v0.3.7, clusterctl version should be >= v0.3.7.

When used as a library, clusterctl does not provide compatibility guarantees. While code should not be deleted and should follow some deprecation phase, breaking changes can happen when necessary.
