*NOTE: There is an [issue](
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/655) to automate the 
publishing of GitBook updates. For now these instructions are still partially 
manual while we gain experience with autogenerated commits to ensure we do not
publish broken documentation...*

# Rebuild the GitBook

```
hack/build-gitbook.sh
```

# Verify the contents of the GitBook are correct by viewing the pages which 
should include new or changed content and:

0) Ensuring the expected changes are there.
1) They are rendered as expected.

```
cd docs/book
gitbook serve
# open localhost:4000 in a web browser
```

# Finally submit a PR to the gh-pages branch in order to publish the changes

git add docs/book/_book
git commit
git subtree push --prefix docs/book/_book/ origin gh-pages
```
