*NOTE: There is an issue to fully automate the publishing of Gitbook updates:
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/655 For now these 
instructions are still partially manually while we gain experience with
autogenerated commits to ensure we do not publish broken documentation...*

# Rebuild the Gitbook

```
hack/build-gitbook.sh
```

# Verify that they appear to be correct

cd docs/book
gitbook serve
open localhost:4000

# Finally submit a PR to the gh-pages branch in order to publish the changes

git add docs/book/_book
git commit
git checkout gh-pages
git cherry-pick <commit-id>
git push origin gh-pages
```
